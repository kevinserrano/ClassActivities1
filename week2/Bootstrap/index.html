                <p>
                    I was born Nov. 30th 1984 in San Marcos, TX. I currently reside in San Antonio, TX and work in
                    the
                    oil field
                    industry. The company I work for is based out of Oklahoma City and we provide many forms of
                    communication
                    to companies out in the oil field. I have two beautiful and amazing children and to top it off
                    an
                    equally
                    amazing and beautiful wife.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am also currently a part-time student at UTSA and I am studying on becoming a web developer.
                    My
                    drive in
                    life is my family and the need and want to provide an amazing life for them. I am
                    extremely close to my father, Al Serrano who is now retired from a 37yr career with Wal-Mart
                    where
                    he
                    reached
                    Regional Vice President status. I would have to credit him for instilling the values of hard
                    work
                    and
                    family.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As you can tell from the image provided I love the Great Outdoors and anything that comes with
                    it. I
                    enjoy
                    everything from
                    hiking, to hunting, and fishing. I find the outdoors a place of peace and relaxation.
